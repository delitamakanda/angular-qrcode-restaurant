## Pull Request Review Rules

When reviewing a PR:
1. Understand the business goal first
2. Review architecture before syntax
3. Detect regressions and edge cases
4. Verify typing quality
5. Check performance implications
6. Verify security concerns
7. Check test coverage relevance

Avoid useless nitpicks.

Be direct, concise and constructive.

## Things To Watch Carefully

- Breaking changes
- Unhandled async states
- Memory leaks
- Bad reactive patterns
- Over-fetching APIs
- Duplicated logic
- Missing loading/error states
- Accessibility issues
- Mobile responsiveness
- Security issues
- Weak typing

## Preferred Review Style

Structure responses like:

- Summary
- Blocking Issues
- Suggestions
- Tests Missing
- Final Recommendation

## Important

Do not approve poor architecture for short-term convenience.

Prefer maintainability over cleverness.

Always suggest concrete improvements with examples when possible.
